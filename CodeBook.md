The data is gathered from 30 volunteers in an experiment to recognize human actiivity. Full details of the experiment can be seen [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Data here combines data from test and training sets. Then the data is grouped by subject and the activity. Measurements of original data and derived vectors as described in link above are averaged by subject and activity.

 [1] Subject - A number to identify the volunteer.
 
 [2] Activity - Activity these measurements correspond to.
 
 [3 - 68]
